## Installation

Currently, Hammerhead has not yet released an on-device app store that allows users to easily install 
extensions like this. Until it is available, you can sideload the app.

1. Download the apk (or build it from source)
2. Set up your Karoo for sideloading. DC Rainmaker has a great [step-by-step guide](https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2021/02/how-to-sideload-android-apps-on-your-hammerhead-karoo-1-karoo-2.html).
