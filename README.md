## Installation

Currently, Hammerhead has not yet released an on-device app store that allows users to easily install 
extensions like this. Until it is available, you can sideload the app.

1. Download the apk from the [releases page](https://github.com/timklge/karoo-reminder/releases) (or build it from source)
2. Set up your Karoo for sideloading. DC Rainmaker has a great [step-by-step guide](https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2021/02/how-to-sideload-android-apps-on-your-hammerhead-karoo-1-karoo-2.html).
3. Install the app by running `adb install app-release.apk`.
